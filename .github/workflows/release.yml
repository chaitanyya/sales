            See the assets below to download and install Qualify for your platform.

            ### Installation

            1. Download the `.dmg` file for your architecture
            2. Open the `.dmg` and drag Qualify to Applications
            3. **Before opening**, run this command in Terminal to remove the quarantine flag:
               ```
               xattr -cr /Applications/Qualify.app
               ```
            4. Open Qualify from Applications

            > **Note:** Qualify is not yet code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it. The `xattr` command above removes the quarantine flag and allows it to run.
